# Metro Rail System Fix Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions to fix the issues in your Metro Rail project.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Use the System Fix Tool**: 
   - Go to: `http://localhost/metro-rail/system_fix.php`
   - Click on "Reset Admin Password to 'admin123'"
   - Then click on "Login as Admin"

2. **Check diagnostics**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost/metro-rail/system_diagnostics.php`
   - This will show you any remaining issues in the system

3. **Direct Admin Login**:
   - If other methods don't work, go to: `http://localhost/metro-rail/admin/create_admin_session.php`
   - This will create an admin session and redirect to the admin dashboard

## What Was Fixed

1. **Header Output Issues**:
   - Added `ob_start()` to all key files to prevent "headers already sent" errors
   - Fixed issues in `functions.php` related to redirects

2. **Session Handling**:
   - Improved session handling throughout the application
   - Added better checks for session status

3. **Admin Authentication**:
   - Fixed the `hasRole()` function to handle admin roles correctly
   - Improved authentication debugging

4. **User Booking Page**:
   - Fixed the user/booking.php file which was empty

5. **Debug Logging**:
   - Updated debug logging to work correctly in different directory contexts
   - Replaced `fwrite($debug_log,...)` calls with the more reliable `debug_log()`

6. **Database Operations**:
   - Ensured proper database functionality
   - Fixed parameter binding issues

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Headers already sent" Errors**:
   - These are resolved by adding `ob_start()` at the beginning of PHP files

2. **Admin Login Issues**:
   - Use `system_fix.php` to reset admin password and create a session
   - If issues persist, use `create_admin_session.php` for direct login

3. **Session Variables Not Set**:
   - Fixed by ensuring proper session initialization and handling

## Maintaining the System

1. Keep your PHP version updated
2. Regularly check the logs directory for any errors
